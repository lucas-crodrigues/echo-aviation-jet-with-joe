    paragraph1="Most flight schools require you to adapt to their schedule, their pricing, and their pace. Echo Aviation flips that model. You choose your goals, your timeline, and your instructor. Our network of independent CFIs gives you the freedom to train your way, whether that’s full-time or a few hours a week."
    paragraph2="Instead of locking you into a program, we let you secure your spot with a $500 deposit. That deposit goes directly toward your flight training, and reserves you a limited seat with one of our top instructors, each working with just 3–4 students at a time."
